# TODO: Modify Delete Operations for Products, Gallery, and Stories

## Information Gathered
- Stories currently have `relatedProductId` linking to products.
- No direct links to gallery items in stories.
- Need to add `relatedGalleryId` to stories to link to gallery items.
- Delete handlers in API routes need to include related links in the response before deleting.

## Plan
1. Update `IStory` interface in `frontend/src/lib/data.ts` to include `relatedGalleryId?: number;`.
2. Update the `stories` array in `frontend/src/lib/data.ts` to add `relatedGalleryId` to relevant stories.
3. Modify DELETE handler in `frontend/src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` to find and include related story IDs in the response.
4. Modify DELETE handler in `frontend/src/app/api/stories/[id]/route.ts` to include `relatedProductId` and `relatedGalleryId` in the response.
5. Modify DELETE handler in `frontend/src/app/api/gallery/[id]/route.ts` to find and include related story IDs in the response.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- `frontend/src/lib/data.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/stories/[id]/route.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/gallery/[id]/route.ts`

## Followup Steps
- Test the delete operations to ensure links are included in responses.
- Verify that deletions still occur after including links.

## Progress
- [x] Update `IStory` interface in `frontend/src/lib/data.ts` to include `relatedGalleryId?: number;`.
- [x] Update the `stories` array in `frontend/src/lib/data.ts` to add `relatedGalleryId` to relevant stories.
- [x] Remove `ai_hint` and `aiHint` properties from products, stories, and gallery items in `frontend/src/lib/data.ts`.
- [x] Remove the `frontend/src/ai` directory.
- [x] Modify DELETE handler in `frontend/src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` to find and include related story IDs in the response.
- [x] Modify DELETE handler in `frontend/src/app/api/stories/[id]/route.ts` to include `relatedProductId` and `relatedGalleryId` in the response.
- [x] Modify DELETE handler in `frontend/src/app/api/gallery/[id]/route.ts` to find and include related story IDs in the response.
